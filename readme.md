# gulp-iconfont Windows/IE bug

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `gulp iconfont`
4. Compare index.html in various browsers

## Bug?

Chrome renders the same between both, however the gulp-iconfont will add additional spacing in IE only. There is the same font exported from Icomoon as reference.
